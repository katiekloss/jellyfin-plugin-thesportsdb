# Jellyfin TheSportsDB plugin

[![build](https://github.com/katiekloss/jellyfin-plugin-thesportsdb/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/katiekloss/jellyfin-plugin-thesportsdb/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

This is an experimental plugin for pulling metadata from [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com) into Jellyfin media.

It's a work in progress, and I may not finish it (here's hoping, though).

[Dev blog here](https://blog.kat5.dev/category/jellyfin-plugin-thesportsdb/), if you're interested.
