# Jellyfin TheSportsDB plugin

[![build](https://github.com/katiekloss/jellyfin-plugin-thesportsdb/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/katiekloss/jellyfin-plugin-thesportsdb/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

**UPDATE**: I stalled out on this project due to how limited TheSportsDB's free-tier API is. I might come back once their v2 API is available.

This is an experimental plugin for pulling metadata from [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com) into Jellyfin media.

It's a work in progress, and I may not finish it (here's hoping, though).
